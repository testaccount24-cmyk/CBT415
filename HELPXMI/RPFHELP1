                 (Robs's Programming Facility V 2)


  RPF is developed by Rob Prins for Skybird Systems and used
  in the free MVS38J distributions and all MVS successors.

  It operates as a command processor under TSO/VTAM in a MVS38J,
  MVS/380, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS operating system.
  With the exception of MVS38J addressing mode 31 is available.

  RPF provides an easy way of entering and editing data on a lot
  of IBM3270 type terminals. The minimum size of the terminal is
  24 lines x 80 columns. The maximum number of lines = 99 and
  the maximum number of columns = 200. The product of lines x columns
  cannot exceed 16,384 bytes.

  RPF provides an EDIT and VIEW function for sequential data sets or
  PDS(E) members with fixed or variable records and a record length
  between 40 and 255.
  EDIT supports numbered or unnumbered data. Numbered data can be:
  1. Standard, the line numbers are 8 bytes and are in the last
     8 columns for data with a fixed record format or in bytes 0-7,
     if the data has a variable record format.
  2. COBOL, the line numbers are 6 bytes and are in columns 0-5 in
     the data. COBOL data sets or members always have a record
     length of 80 bytes.
  To switch from Standard to COBOL format vice versa, use the EDIT
  primary command COBOL ON or COBOL OFF.

  With the Browse function, browsing of sequential data sets or
  PDS(E) members with fixed or variable records with a record
  length up to 255 is possible.
  If browsing undefined records, record lengths can be up to 32,768.

  RPF has an interface to ASSEMBLE and LINK-EDIT programs in the
  foreground.

  The UTILITY functions provide utilities like creation and deletion
  of data sets, Library functions, LIBRARIAN and ARCHIVER maintenance,
  VTOC functions, Data set list (DS LIST), Reset or delete ISPF
  stats, SEARCH strings in data sets, copy and/or move PDS(E)
  members and an OUTLIST utility.

  The TEST function is implemented only for maintanance by the RPF
  BUILDERS and should not be used by unauthorized users.

  RPF Operator mode enables you to look at the current system activity.
  When using RPFOPER, enter 'HELP' to list the available functions.

  In the DEFAULTS menu, you have the possibility to alter:
  1. Workspace size (maximum number of lines to EDIT, based on a record
     length of 80 bytes), SYSOUT class for PRINT, the AUTOSAVE function,
     default prefix for DS LIST, confirm DELETE options, default
     translate to capitals or not or automatically, and default
     terminal characteristics.
  2. Default data set names for EDIT, Browse, PDS, LIBRARIAN and
     Archiver.
  3. Default Program Function Keys (PFK) for the EDIT, Browse, PDS,
     LIBRARIAN, ARCHIVER, Move/Copy and DS LIST screens.
  4. Default Assembler and Linkage editor libraries, the assembler
     program name, Assembler and Linkage Editor execute parameters
     and Linkage Editor control statements.

  All these defaults will be saved in member @RPFPROF in a card image
  partitioned data set with DDNAME //ISPPROF.

  Notes:
  1. RPF uses the TSO data set naming conventions. Data set names can
     be entered as names enclosed in quotes ('). These data set names
     are treated as fully qualified names.
     If a data set name is entered without quotes, the data set name
     will be prefixed with the TSO prefix.
  2. All the functions of RPF operates in a fullscreen environment,
     except the Operator- and TSO functions.
  3. For a description of all primary- and line commands select
     option 2 in the HELP menu (RPF opt. 7.2).
  4. In each selection menu, the 'END' PFK is supported (PF03 and PF15).
  5. LIBRARIAN is a product of Broadcom (former Computer Associates)
     and is not included in RPF, except the free-to-use
     LIBRARIAN FAIR routines.
  6. Archiver is a free program, which can be downloaded from
     www.cbttape.org, file number 147. Archiver is a great tool
     to archive data sets or members in one single VSAM cluster.
     Archiver is written by Rick Fochtman and maintained by me.
