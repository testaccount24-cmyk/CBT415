//*       Under free MVS 3.8, where ISPF is not available, the      *   FILE 415
//*       RPF editor is often used by many people, because          *   FILE 415
//*       it provides quite a few ISPF-like capabilities, and       *   FILE 415
//*       the RPF editor feels a lot like the ISPF editor.          *   FILE 415

//*       This version of RPF (2.0.0) can be assembled either       *   FILE 415

//*       Before you assemble RPF, check member SYSVARS in the ASM  *   FILE 415
//*       library and set the variables to the correct value.       *   FILE 415
//*       Assemble is not really needed, you can install the load   *   FILE 415

//*      RPF is a command processor under TSO, developed by Rob     *   FILE 415
//*      Prins, member of the systems programming department of     *   FILE 415
//*      the ING Bank in Amsterdam.  For program development the    *   FILE 415
//*      ING Bank used ROSCOE, but when the systems programming     *   FILE 415
//*      group started using TSO for maintenance, the need arose    *   FILE 415
//*      for a full-screen editor under TSO.  At this point Rob     *   FILE 415
//*      decided to develop his own editor, not only because        *   FILE 415
//*      they needed an editor, but also for learning the           *   FILE 415
//*      internals of TSO.  This resulted in the 'RPF' package.     *   FILE 415
//*                                                                 *   FILE 415
//*      It is not only an editor, but it also includes             *   FILE 415
//*      functions like PDS maintenance (SCRATCH, RENAME EDIT,      *   FILE 415
//*      PRINT, BROWSE and assigning ALIAS), foreground assembly    *   FILE 415
//*      and binding, VTOC listing, dataset allocation and          *   FILE 415
//*      deletion and even a LIBRARIAN, PANVALET and ARCHIVE        *   FILE 415
//*      interface to read and write modules or items to a          *   FILE 415
//*      LIBRARIAN disk master, a PANVALET library or an ARCHIVER   *   FILE 415
//*      archive VSAM cluster and a TSO command processor           *   FILE 415
//*      to execute TSO commands in RPF.                            *   FILE 415
//*      ARCHIVER is written by Rick Fochtman and is available      *   FILE 415
//*      in file 147 on www.cbttape.org                             *   FILE 415

//*      The main advantage of an inhouse developed package is,     *   FILE 415
//*      that the source is available, so that it can be tailored   *   FILE 415
//*      to the demands of the user.  As the package became         *   FILE 415
//*      available to the users (the systems programmers) they      *   FILE 415
//*      very soon stopped using ROSCOE for program development,    *   FILE 415
//*      which indicated that it is a very useful product.  RPF     *   FILE 415
//*      is using the MVS operating system.  Afterwards the RPF     *   FILE 415
//*      product became available for the members of the Hercules   *   FILE 415
