Hi Sam,

I have installed a new version in the Dallas system.
I am so happy with this system!!!!

This version supports large terminals up to 62 lines x 160 columns.
All the sizes between 24x80 to 62x160 are supported by the most screens.

A few not often used screens will not support these large sizes, but will be aut
So you always can use a large screen.

You can test RPF by yourself, because RPF is installed in SYS1.W$$.LINKLIB.

Please see the screens by yourself.

All the best to you, your friends and your family.

Sincerely,
Rob
