Hi Sam,

Thanks for your interest in RPF.

I started to write Rob's Programming Facility (RPF) in 1979,
because my employer did not want to buy (I)SPF.  We used Roscoe
in 1979.  However I am a systems programmer and I hated Roscoe.
I was a TSO user and I want to edit my data with a fullscreen
editor.  That's why I have written RPF.  In 1985 I made a
second version of RPF, called RPF/XA.  This version is only in a
MVS/XA system or higher.  After this I stopped developing RPF,
because ISPF was used.  Since the Hercules people work with MVS
3.8J, I continued to develop RPF and I have no objection putting
RPF on the CBT-tape.

Of course. If you have suggestions concerning RPF, I'd like to
hear that.

With kind regards,

Rob

I am proud, that many Herculeans are using RPF.
