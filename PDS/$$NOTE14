Dear Sam,

As promised since the last telephone call.
The latest version of RPF V1R9M5 is complete.

I had built the MVS-Turnkey 5 completely with RPF and I met some
awkward things and some errors.

Like: copy of sequential datasets was impossible, creating
members from data with invalid characters was a problem, Browse
was very storage consuming and sometimes not.  The complete data
could not be browsed because of storage exhaustion.

Copy of entire partitioned datasets with invalid member names
(like SMPCDS) ran in an error.

Output supports now printing into a dataset. The EDIT C primary
command destroyed data, if the data has invalid characters.

You can select now in Archiver items, groups, subgroups and
types. The DSLIST (opt 3.4) has now a REFRESH primary command.

All these things are fixed and added.

More info about the changes can be found in RPF 7.5 and in member
$$INTRO.

Would you like to post RPF195 onto the Updates section of CBT?

All the best of everything to you and your family.

Met vriendelijke groet/With kind regards/Mit freundlichen
Gruessen/Saludos Cordiales
