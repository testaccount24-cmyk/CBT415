Dear Sam,



After more than 3 months, RPF191 is here.

The release is a maintenance release with some update functions.

In this release, 32 modules are now reentrant and reusable.

The most significant update is the new TSO command processor
RPFV.

RPFV presents the DSLIST function of RPF (RPF 3.4) from the READY
mode or from ISPF.

With HELP RPFV or in the User's guide you will find more
information about RPFV.

Another update is allowing numbered data if the dataset or member
contains variable records.

You will find the release notes below and of course with RPF 7.5



RPFEDIT   Primary commands I 0,n and CO/MO n,m,0 fixed.
                    Numbered variable data supported with line
                    numbers in columns 1-8.
                    Primary command SCOPE renamed into BNDS.
                    Redefine the default boundaries (BNDS) as follows:
                    COBOL data: columns 7-72
