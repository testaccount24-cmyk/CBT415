 Dear Sam,

 I have made some changes in the documentation of RPF 1.8.8.

 The preferred installation method is using the file 415 from CBT.

 And I have uploaded separate xmi file on my own website for an
 alternative installation.

 All the documentation has been updated for this 'new' method of
 install.

 Please use the file in the attachment.

 Sincerely,   Rob
