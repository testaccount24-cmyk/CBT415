Installation Checklist
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The FILE415.XMI file (this file) is mapped as an XMIT dataset.
Upload the XMI dataset with PC 3270 file transfer like IND$FILE
with the binary option.
If you have NJE38 installed in MVS 3.8J or use TSO/E in OS/390 or
z/OS, execute the following TSO command RECEIVE.

RECEIVE INDATASET('uploaded dataset name')
and reply 'Enter restore parameters or END' with:
DA('dataset name')

An alternative way is to run the RECV370 utility of Jim Morrison.
You will find RECV370 in file 571 on cbttape.org.

Now we are ready to install RPF. If you follow the instructions
below, installation is a piece of cake.

Required jobs
-------------

- Run job $INSTMVS to install RPF in MVS 3.8J Turnkey 5 or
  higher or in MVS 3.8J where NJE38 is installed.
  If NJE38 is not installed, run job $INSTALT.
  In this case XMIT370 and RECV370 of Jim Morrison should
  be installed (file 571 on cbttape.org)

                          ---- OR ----

  Run job $INSTZOS to install RPF in an OS/390 or z/OS system.

- Download member $MANUAL# with IND$FILE with the binary option
  to your workstation for the PDF version of the RPF Users' Guide
  and /or ...
  Download member $MANUAL@ with IND$FILE with the binary option
  to your workstation for the MS WORD version of the RPF User's
  Guide.

Optional job
------------

- Run job $PROFILE to allocate a card-image profile partitioned
  data set. Run this job only, if IBM's ISPF or Wally's ISPF is
  not installed and RPF V2 is installed for the first time.

Notes for OS390 or z/OS.
------------------------
- Update member IKJTSOxx to specify programs RPF and RPFMAIN in the
  AUTHCMD statement.
  Activate this member with the command PARMLIB UPDATE(xx).

Notes for MVS38J or MVS380.
---------------------------

- It is recommended to install usermods ZP60008 and ZP60009.
  ZP60008 and ZP60009 makes larger screens than 1920 bytes (24x80)
  possible (support the Erase Write Alternate, EWA and TPUT NOEDIT).
  Screensizes can be up to 16384 bytes.
  If ZP60008 and ZP60009 are not applied, RPF works well on a
  standard 24x80 screen.
  These usermods can be found on the site of Greg Price
  http://www.prycroft6.com.au/vs2mods/index.html.
  If running MVS38J TK4- or MVS38J TK5 (distributed by JÃ¼rgen
  Winkelmann and me), ZP60008 and ZP60009 are already applied.

- If you are installing RPF for the very first time on MVS38J or
  from version 1 release 9.1, check and possible modify, and
  run the job in member ZUM0001 in library SYS1.UMODCNTL
  to make RPF, RPFMAIN and RPFV authorized in TSO.
  Before submit of ZUM0001 check the contents of member IKJEFTE2
  in library SYS1.UMODSRC, for MVS Turnkey 3 and MVS Turnkey 4-.
  Re-apply the usermod and IPL with CLPA to activate usermod ZUM0001.

- If your MVS 3.8J system is based upon MVS Turnkey 5, ZUM0001 is
  already applied and no action is needed.
  In MVS-TK5 ZUM0001 is resident in library USERMOD.ZUM0001.

Now, the installation of RPF is finished. Logon to TSO and try out
RPF. Have a lot of fun.
