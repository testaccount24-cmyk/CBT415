Dear Sam,

Are you interested in a stand-alone foreground assembler in ISPF?

With program RPFASM00 you can assemble and link programs in ISPF.

RPFASM00 uses program RPFASM (like option 4 in RPF).

RPFASM00 sets the variables like MACLIB's, the source library,
the assembler PARM, the linkage editor PARM and the linkage
editor control statements in the ISPF profile.

You can call RPFASM00 with PGM(RPFASM00) in ISPF.

Or you can call RPFASM00 in ISPF option 6.

You can test it by yourself with
CALL  ' Z531415.RPF174.LOAD(RPFASM00)' in ISPF option 6.

Specify the parameters and assemble and/or link.

Afterwards the parameters are saved in the ISPF profile, so with
the next call the parameters are retrieved.
RPFASM00 is already implemented in ISPF panel ISRFPA (Foreground)

All the best to you and your family,

Sincerely, Rob
