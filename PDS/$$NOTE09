Subject: RPF 190 Release Notes

Dear Sam,

I found some known issues in RPF 189. (a few 0c4 abends and
incorrouts).

That√¢ is why I have release RPF190.

RPF190 has 1 new function and that is Browse substitution if you
try to EDIT a RECFM=U dataset or library.

The rest are fixes and I have changed 9 modules to make these
re-entrant. 24 modules are now re-entrant.

And the most dynamic allocations are changed in TSO IKJDAIR calls
to make RPF compatible with pre-MVS versions.

And last but not lease. Some DCB abend exits are written to
intercepts IO errors and authorization abends.

The release notes are:

RPFSAVE Fix wrong entry in PDS (3.1) after (AUTO)SAVE after 'E'
line command.
RPFVTOC1 Module made re-entrant and re-usable.
RPFFIND Module made re-entrant and re-usable.
RPFALLOC Dynamic allocations replaced by IKJDAIR calls.
DSNTYPE removed and RACHECK/RACROUTE REQUEST=AUTH added to check
authorization before create.
RPFPDS Module made re-entrant and re-usable.
RPFBRO Screen area moved to a GETMAIN'ed area and made dependent
of screen size. Internal DATE routine replaced by call to
RPFCNVDT.
RPFSAVE Abend 0C4 fixed if entering option 5 (Archiver).
RPFDATAL Search string not blanked after SEARCH in opt. 3.8
RPFARCH Dynamic allocations replaced by IKJDAIR calls and module
made re-entrant and re-usable.
RPFARSVE Dynamic allocations replaced by IKJDAIR calls and module

RPFHELP Module made re-entrant and re-usable.
RPFDOC Module made re-entrant and re-usable and internal DATE

RPFSTAT Module made re-entrant and re-usable and internal DATE

RPFMAIN and RPFVTOC1 Substitute BROWSE if trying to EDIT a
dataset with RECFM=U.
