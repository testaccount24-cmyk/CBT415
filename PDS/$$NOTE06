Dear Sam,

I am delighted to present RPF Version 1, release 7.9

This version contains a lot of enhancements and some fixes.

The change log:

RPFDATAL Check record length of V(B) data sets in the correct way.
RPFSAVE  Check record length of V(B) data sets in the correct way.
RPFUTIL  Treat IMON (opt 3.7) as a 'real' TSO command processor.
RPFPDS   Set workspace record length to 80 on exit to make edit
         current workspace possible.
RPFVTOC1 Set workspace record length to 80 on exit to make edit
         current workspace possible.
RPFBRO   Alias FIND of 'F' command added.
RPFCHNG  Loop fixed if 'C //string/' is given.
C /P'.'/string2/ change invalid strings supported.
Flag the workspace lines if data is changed.
RPFEDIT  Allow numerics in command along with line commands
         (implicit L+ or L- command)
Fix a convert error if the DEL or EOF key was used in the
         Line-number field.
Reverse the line numbers if the line is changed with the 'C'
         subcommand.
Handle I/O error after APPEND correctly.
RPFSRCH Allow quoted search strings in option 3.8
RPFEDITL Add SYNAD routine to prevent ABEND001 in RPFEDIT and
         give a suitable message.
RPFBRO Add SYNAD routine and handle the I/O error correctly.
RPFFIND F x'hhhhhh....' (HEX Find) subcommand supported.
'O' subcommand deleted.
RPFJCL Accept REGION=nM in JOB card and EXEC card.
Give warning message with NOTIFY=&SYSUID
Large screen supported.
RPF Allow terminals with buffer up to 9920 bytes (like 62x160 or
         99x100) and minor enhancements implemented.

In the next version the browse of loadmodules will be implemented.

It take some time to accomplish that, but I have already a prototype.

Another issue is the size of the 3270. It's now limited to 9920
characters (62x160), but 99x80 is also possible. At the moment I
use a 72x132 terminal (75x132 is also possible).

Screens larger than 9920 needs compression. I have a compression
routine, but is not quite working at this moment and needs
investigation.

Would you like to include RPF179 on CBT with the enclosed file?

Thank you in advance,

All the best of everything to you and your family.

BTW: The z/OS 2.4 system is great!

Met vriendelijke groet/With kind regards
