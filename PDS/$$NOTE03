Hi Sam.

The last week I have tested RPF 171 on all kind of systems like
the Dallas (z/OS) system, MVS380 (an update on MVS38j with AM31
capabilities) and the TK3 and TK4- systems.

I was satisfied, but I noticed some issues.

1. The translate tables were not optimal, so I have changed these
   tables. That is a big enhancement.

2. In EDIT the records were not completely translated. That
   resulted in some screen errors.

3. The JCL checker did not check the LRECL of the JCL dataset and
   I have translated the comments in the source from Dutch to
   English.

4. The foreground assembler did not check the LRECL of the
   source, So abend013-34 can occur.

6. Sometimes the Rxx line command in EDIT resulted in an ABEND0C4

7. The Ixx line command in EDIT did not work correctly.

8. The return code 36 in RPFDAIR was not documented.

9. Submit in EDIT did not check the record length of the input.

This is all corrected now.
Treat this version as the Summer 2019 version of RPF.

Please update the version of RPF 1.7.1. with the enclosed one if you wish.

All the best for you and your family and friends,

Met vriendelijke groet/With kind regards/Mit freundlichen
