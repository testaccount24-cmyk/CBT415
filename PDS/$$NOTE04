Dear Sam,

I am happy to announce RPF 1.7.6.

This release contains a lot of improvements, like changing HEX
strings, the FIND P'.' command and a better parsing of the
EDIT and PDS member list subcommands.

Here are the release notes:

RPFSAVE If numbered data saved into a new member, reset last 2
columns instead of columns 79-80.

RPFEDIT ABEND0C7 fixed if I *,0 or DEL *,0 given.

The command can be set in any place in the command area.

Terminate EDIT if workspace is too small.

Parse all subcommands correctly before executing.

Commands 'C /X'hh..'/', 'C //X'hh..''
and 'C /X'hh..'/X'hh..'' (hh = 0-9, A-F) supported.

RPFFIND If a string is more than 1 times on the same line, give
subsequent matches in the same line if only an 'F' is entered
(repeat find) and place the cursor on the found string.

Support F P'.' to search invalid characters.

RPFOUT Message 'Unexpected return code' changed into 'Invalid
CANCEL request' (the real reason).

RPFTSO Test on lowercase 'end' and protect CALLTSSR with GAMOS/GAMAPP

RPFBRO Browse larger datasets possible if addressing mode is NOT 24.

RPFINIT Append userid in key RPF profile cluster always to 7
bytes. If userid < 7 bytes replace ' ' by '-' to get always a
unique key.

Default workspace size increased to 6,000 lines.

RPFPDS Parse all subcommands correctly before executing and allow
DEL and/or EOF key in the complete screen.

RPFMVCPY Allow DEL and/of EOF key in command field and parse the
primary commands.

And I found a very old error (loop in the C subcommand).

RPF Is becoming more and more stable.

All the best of everything to you and your family
