Hi Sam,

Just before the release of MVS Turnkey 5 update-4, there is a new
release of RPF.

It does contain a few new functions, but the most are fixes and
changed standards.

Also, the user's guide is updated.

The release notes:

RPF      The prefix '&' of the primary commands is deleted.
          Increase message length from 22 to 25 bytes.

RPFARCH  Abend0C4 fixed in line command 'N' if the EDIT workspace
          is located above the 16MB line.
          Display the true name, GROUP, SUBGROUP, TYPE and VERSION
          of the aliases and aliases are made non selectable for

          line commands.
          Fix selection of always the latest version of an ITEM,
          if more than 1 version is in the ARCHIVE with line command
          E,B or V.
          Display aliases and delete alias too with 'D' line
          command before true name.

RPFBRO   Browse: ISPF vv.mm in header if present.
          All NON-VSAM data sets supported but truncated to
          record length=255.

RPFEDIT  Allow primary command CUT with MM-MM line commands.
          and give options SAVE, CANCEL or END if data changed
          and AUTOSAVE=N.
          If only a blank is added in an inserted line, keep
          that line.

RPFOUT   Display all jobs if a duplicate is detected

Would you like to post the attached file on CBT?

All the best of everything to you and your family.
