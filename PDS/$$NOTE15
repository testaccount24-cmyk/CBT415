Dear Sam,

Finally RPF196 is here.

These are the release notes:

What is new in Release 1.9.6?

    RPFEDIT   ABEND0C4 fixed with L +/- very large number.
                      EDIT: Primary commands LEFT and RIGHT can be
                      used to scroll from the cursor position if the
                      scroll amount is set to CSR.
                      The default BNDS values covers only the visible
                      part of the screen.

    RPFBRO     No DOWN command needed anymore before a repeat
                      FIND, this known issue is fixed.
                      Add primary command ASCII to toggle translate
                      from ASCII to EBCDIC or not in BROWSE.
                      Fix wrong message after trying to submit a non
                      card image dataset.

    RPFVTOC1 Support UNZIP of .ZIP datasets before browsing.
                      Fix 'invalid command' during UP and DOWN primary
                      commands and fix '=n' primary command in DSLIST.

    RPFARCH   RENAME of ITEM/GROUP/SUBGROUP/TYPE supported
                      with line command R.
                      VERSION not substituted if a DELETE was issued
                      for ITEMs without GROUP,SUBGROUP and TYPE. Fixed.

    RPFMAIN   Dataset to be edited/browsed/PDS unallocated if
                      main menu displayed to prevent wait conditions.

After many tests, RPF 196 is stable.

Would you like to post it on CBT?  (My note:  OF COURSE)

Many thanks in advance.

All the best of everything to you and your family.
