RPF - It is not ISPF, but pretty close.

Introduction

RPF is a TSO command processor written by Rob Prins, and it is in
some aspects very similar to (I)SPF. Also, while he holds the
copyright to his work, he allows the Hercules community to use
and distribute it. The latest available Version for the Hercules
community is currently RPF Version 2 Release 0 Modification 0.

Release notes:

What is new in Release 2.0.0?
!!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Please read. RPF uses now the standard TSO
                    naming conventions.

 RPF      RPF version 2 is converted to use TSO data set
          naming conventions.
          If a data set name is entered without quotes,the
          data set name will be prefixed with the TSO prefix,
          set by the TSO command PROFILE PREFIX(prefix) or
          with the TSO UserID (default).
          If the data set name is entered between quotes,
          the data name is treated as fully qualified.
          The end quote is optional.
 RPFMAIN  TSO prefix in main menu.
 RPFEDIT  Primary command 'COPY' with line commands 'A'
          (After), 'TT' (before first line) or 'BB' (after

          If the message 'Bottom of data reached' is met
          after a F(IND) primary command and a subsequent
          F(IND) is given immediately after the previous
          F(IND), search will start from the beginning.

 RPF      The profile VSAM cluster is obsolete and replaced
          by the partitioned data set allocated with DD-name

What is new in Release 1.4.2?

Rob has again implemented a few enhacement to increase useability
of his fine program:

   * The possibility the edit data with non-printables. It is not
     a hex edit, but you change the editable data without
     destroying the lines with non printables, so you edit data
     with e.g. object decks. In the former releases all the
     printable data was translated into colons.
   * New inserted lines will be highlighted if they are empty. If
     data is entered in an inserted line the highlighting of that
     line will disappear. The empty inserted lines will not be
     saved or submitted.  This is the way like VM XEDIT it does.
   * The COPY command in EDIT is improved.
   * You can specify the UNIT type in Alloc (option 3.1)
   * RPFSTAT has got a new screen (option 0.0)
   * The 'M' command is supported in the member selection list
     (scroll max).

What was new in Release 1.4.1?

   * Using the END command (PFK3) will now return you to the
     invoking screen, not to the main menu. This is true for
        o Browse (Option 1)
        o Edit (Option 2)
        o PDS Maintenance (Option 3.4)
   * You can now select a member with the 'S member' command in
     the member selection list
   * Check the documentation RPF User's guide or member RPFUGUID
     in the attached source library.

What was new in Release 1.4?

   * A few bug fixes
   * RPFDATAU: Module deleted. Functions moved to RPFDATAL
     RPFDATAL: Dataset selection list implemented. Module will
     also be used for utility functions This list is a history of
     the last edited datasets and will be written in the RPF
     database if RPF exits. No conversion of the database is
     needed. RPF will just write a second record per user.
   * RPFFIND: Find string matches if string is the same and can
     be entered in mixed case
   * RPFPDS: Bug fixed if EDIT invoked and COPY command given
   * RPFMAIN: SMF system id in main menu
   * RPFEDIT: Save the data in the same dataset/member if the END
     subcommand has been given. Save only if the data has been
     changed (the ISPF way)
   * CANCEL command added, with alias CAN to exit EDIT without
     saving the data.
   * RPFLIB LIBRARIAN tape master files supported
   * RPFBRO SUB(MIT) command added in Browse.
   * See the included RPF User's guide or member RPFUGUID in the
     attached source library.

What was new in Release 1.3?

   * A few bug fixes
   * RPFBRO introduced for browsing data RPFBRO has a lot of new
     commands.
   * RPFASM has got a new screen
   * The output of RPFASM will be browsed with RPFBRO and more
     assembles/links can be done without leaving the foreground
     assembler menu.
   * RPFLIB (running librarian implemented) Option 3.5 is
     available. This is nice for people who have masterfiles of
     librarian (a product of ADR, later Computer Associates)
   * RPFOUT output will be browsed with RPFBRO.
   * The maclibs, assembler parm, linkage editor parm control
     statements will be saved in the RPF database
