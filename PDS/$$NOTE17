Dear Sam,

Finally, I am satisfied with the release of RPF 1.9.8.
I have made a lot of updates on RPF.
There are several new features and many improvements and some
bugfixes.

And I checked and updated the naming conventions in the panels.
E.g., DSN, DSname is now 'Data set name'. Volume is 'Volume
serial', and Member is ' Member name'.

One exception is the Assembler screen (option 4),

One module is completely rewritten. That is RPFLISTC. This module
is now using SUPERLOCATE instead of LINK to IDCAMS to create the
data set selection list.

Would you like posting this version (see the attachment) onto CBT?
Thank you in advance.
All the best of everything to you and your family.
