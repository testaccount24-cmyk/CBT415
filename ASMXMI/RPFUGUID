:h2.Introduction.
:p.
RPF is a command processor under TSO, developed by Rob Prins
member of the systems programming department of the ING
Bank in Amsterdam. For program development the ING Bank used ROSCOE,
but when the systems programming group started using TSO for
maintenance, the need arose for a full-screen editor under TSO. at
this point Rob decided to develop their own editor, not only
because they needed an editor, but also for learning the internals of
TSO. This resulted in the 'RPF' package. It is not only an editor,
but it also includes functions like Library Functions (SCRATCH, RENAME
EDIT, PRINT, BROWSE, and assigning ALIAS), foreground assembly and
link edit, VTOC, and catalog listing, data set allocation and
deletion and even a LIBRARIAN
and ARCHIVER interface to read and write modules on a disk
master file and a TSO command processor to execute TSO commands in
RPF.  The main advantage of an inhouse developed package is, that the
source is available, so that it can be tailored to the demands of the
user. As the package became available to the users (the systems
programmers) they very soon stopped using ROSCOE for program
development, which indicated that it is a very useful product.  RPF
runs in a MVS38J, MVS/380, MVS/XA, MVS/ESA, OS/390 and z/OS operating
system. Afterwards the RPF product became available for the members
of the Hercules group.
:p.RPF supports a lot of screen sizes. The minimum size = a 3270
model 2 (24 lines x 80 columns). The maximum size is 99 lines.
The maximum screen width = 200 bytes.
All sizes in between are supported (exampe: 99x132).
The maximum buffer size (screen width x screen size) = 16384
(16K).

:h3.RPF data set naming conventions.
:p.
All data set names entered in the RPF panels uses the standard
TSO data set naming conventions.
:p.
If a data set name is entered enclosed in single quotes ('), the
data set name is treated as fully qualified.
:p.
Data set names entered without quotes will be prefixed with the TSO
prefix. The TSO prefix is defaulted to the UserID, but can be altered
with the TSO command:
:p.
:xmp.
PROFILE PREFIX('new prefix')
:exmp.
:p.
E.g., It the name A.CNTL is entered and the TSO prefix is A0611, the
data set name would be A0611.A.CNTL.
:p.
A data set name entered as 'SYS1.PARMLIB' remains unchanged.
:p.
:h2.How to start RPF.
:p.
RPF is a TSO command processor for full screen data editing, and
utility functions.
RPF can be activated by entering the command 'RPF' on
your TSO terminal.
:h3.How to work with RPF.
:p.
If you start RPF a profile member will be read from a partitioned
data set with a record length of 80 with defaults for your userid.
The member name = @RPFPROF.
If the member is not present, the member will be created by RPF.
.br
The DD-statement ISPPROF in the TSO LOGON procedure should point
to the profile data set. If omitted, RPF choose her own defaults.
.br
You also can start RPF with an option. E.g., RPF 3.4 will go directly
to DSLIST.
:p.
After RPF has started without operands, the following main menu
appears on the screen.

Figure 1. RPF main menu
:h2 id=def. Change session defaults.
:p.
The session defaults are placed in member @RPFPROF in the
partitioned data set specified in the ISPPROF DD-statement
of the TSO logon procedure or allocated with the TSO ALLOCATE command.
:p.
You can change the following defaults in the profile member:
:p.
:ol.
:li.The maximum number of lines for the editor. The minimum is 500
lines, and the maximum is 999,999 lines.  Default is 7,000 lines.
:li.SYSOUT class. The default is SYSOUT class C. SYSOUT class will
be used in the print commands of RPF.
:li.Logging YES or NO. This default is for future use.
:li.Nulls YES or NO. This default will set the RPF
editor in NULLS mode or NONULLS mode.
:li.AUTOSAVE Y or N. With this default the workspace will
be saved automatically if AUTOSAVE=Y. With AUTOSAVE=N, EDIT will
issue the message 'Enter SAVE, CANCEL or END'.
:li.
Replace = YES or NO. The parameter defaults the Replace like members
in Move/Copy.
:li.
Default prefix. This is a field of maximum 17 bytes containing the
default prefix in the data set list menu (opt. 3.4).
:li.
COLS = Y or N. Set or reset the scale line in EDIT.
:li.
Confirm = / or <blank>. Set 'Confirm member delete' for Library
Functions and Archiver interface.
:li.
CAPS = AUT, ON or OFF. Set CAPS mode for EDIT. If AUT = specified,
EDIT will automatically detect if lower case characters and sets
CAPS to OFF. If no lower case characters are detected, CAPS will
be set to OFF.
.br
If CAPS = ON, EDIT will set CAPS to ON, no matter whether lower
case characters are detected or not.
.br
IF CAPS = OFF, EDIT will set CAPS to OFF, even if only upper-case
characters are detected.
:li.
The default program name of the assembler. This name is used in the
assembler menu (option 4).
:li.Default allocations.
You can specify the default member name,
data set name for EDIT, Browse, utility and assembler functions.
For LIBRARIAN, the default module name and LIBRARIAN master
file can be specified. For the ARCHIVER,
the default Archive VSAM cluster can be specified.
:li.Printer. Specify the remote printer. If nothing
specified, the output will be routed to a LOCAL printer.
:li.PFK settings:   You can set the commands in the PFKs (1 to 24)
The use of all PFKs is supported in EDIT, BROWSE
Library Functions, LIBRARIAN maintenance and HELP
functions.
The use of the END PFK (PF03 or PF15) is
supported in all selection menus.
Meaning of the 'CON' attribute:
CON=Y: The command in the PFK will set in the
command area on the screen, but will not be
executed.
To execute the command you should press ENTER
CON=N: The command will be executed
immediately.
CON=X: The PFK has gotten the 'UNDEFINED' status.
:li.Assembler maclibs. Specify up to 6 maclibs.
:li.Assembler parm. This is the default assembler parm in the
foreground assembly.
:li.Linkage editor parm. This is the default linkage editor parm in the
foreground assembly.
:li.Linkage editor control statements. 6 optional statements used by
the linkage editor.
:eol.
:p.
All the changed defaults will be written on the profile data set
if present.
.br
If you select -0- on the main menu the default menu appears on the
screen:
:p.
With selection -0- you can list the status of your RPF session.
In this screen the date and time, session duration, EDIT options,
default options, current allocation, workspace size and lines of
the workspace in use are to be displayed.
Press ENTER to leave this status screen.
:p.
With -1- you can change the workspace size, the logging,
the SYSOUT class, Autosave, Submit, Replace, default prefix,
COLS attribute, and CONFIRM attribute.
To change these defaults, press ENTER after the changes made.
To cancel the changes, use PF03/PF15.
:p.
With -2- you can change the
default allocations, LIBRARIAN and ARCHIVER allocations.
To change these defaults press ENTER after the changes made.
To cancel the changes, use PF03/PF15.
:p.
With -3- you can change your PFK settings.
:p.
With -4- you can update the assembler program name, assembler
maclibs, assembler- and linkage editor parameters,
parameters, and the default linkage editor control statements.
.br
To leave the default menus press PF03/PF15.
:p.
It is also possible to select the default functions directly from
the RPF main menu, without interference of the defaults menu (e.g.
select '0.1' for increase workspace). If the function is terminated
in this case, RPF always returns to the main menu.
:h2 id=brw. Browse data sets, members or load modules.
:p.
If you select -1- on the RPF main menu, a data entry screen will
be displayed for selection of the to be browsed data set.
You can select the data sets in two ways:
:ul c.
:li.Select the member name/data set name (and volume serial) in
the allocation menu.
:li.Select 1 of the data sets in the data set selection menu, by
placing the cursor in the line of the requested data set and hitting
ENTER.
.br
If '=n(.n)' is entered in the member name or data set name,
RPF returns to the main menu and executes option n(.n).
:eul.
After selection of this data set, the BROWSE function will be invoked,
and the data set (and volume serial) will be placed in selection list.
This selection list will be written in the RPF profile data set
upon exit of RPF.
:p.
If the member is not specified, a member selection list has
been displayed.
If you select an 'S' in front of the chosen member, The browse
processor
will be invoked. See also :hdref refid=pdsm for information about
The 'S' line command.
:p.
The following RPF browse primary commands are available:
:dl tsize=18
:dthd.Primary command
:ddhd.Function
:dt.ASCII
:dd.Toggle ASCII mode on or off. If in ASCII mode, the data will
be translated to EBCDIC.
:dt.BOTTOM
:dd.Start display with the bottom of the data set.
An alias of 'BOTTOM' is 'B'.
:dt.C nnn
:dd.Shift the display to column nnn.
nnn should not exceed the record length of the data set.
:dt.DOWN
:dd.Scroll forward from the cursor position if the cursor is in
the data. If the cursor is not in the data, 1 screen will be
scrolled forward.
If you use DOWN with a PFK and an 'M' in the
command field the 'BOTTOM' command will be executed.
:dt.END
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back to the utility allocation menu.
:dt.F 'string'
:dd.search specified character string. All lines, which
contains 'string' will be highlighted, and the
message 'Chars string found' will appear.
If only an 'F' is entered, a repeat find of the
previous specified string will be done.
The find always start from the current position in
the data set. If no match can be found, the message
'Bottom of data reached' will appear.
The quotes (') around 'string' can be omitted, if
no blanks are inside the string.
.br
An alias of F is 'FIND'.
:dt.F x'hhhh..'
:dd.Search for HEX strings in the data set.
:dt.HEX
:dd.Toggle HEX mode of the browser on or off.
In HEX mode, each record contains of 4 lines: 1) The
original line. 2) A hex line containing the high-order HEX nibbles.
3). A hex line containing the low-order nibbles. 4) A separator line.
.br
The HEX command will be ignored if a data set or member with
RECFM=U is browsed.
:dt.LEFT
:dd.Scroll 1 screen to the left (80 bytes for screens
model 2,3,4 and up to 200 bytes for a huge terminal).
:dt.PFK
:dd.Display PFK screen and alter PFKs if you
wish. These PFK changes are only effective
during this RPF session.
To change the PFK-s permanent use the defaults menu.
:dt.PRINT x
:dd.Print the data set into SYSOUT class x.
If you omit the SYSOUT class, the default SYSOUT class will be taken.
:dt.RETURN
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back immediately to the main menu.
:dt.=n or =n.n
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back to MAIN, and option 'n' or
'n.n' will be executed
:dt.RIGHT
:dd.Scroll 1 screen to the right (80 bytes for screens
model 2,3,4 and up to 200 bytes for a huge terminal).
:dt.SUB(MIT)
:dd.Submit the data set with the TSO SUBMIT command.
:dt.TOP
:dd.Start display with the top of the data set.
An alias of 'TOP' is 'T'.
:dt.TSO
:dd.Execute TSO commands. Module RPFTSO will be invoked.
:dt.UP
:dd.Scroll backward to the cursor position if the cursor is
in the data. If the cursor is not in the data, 1 screen will
be scrolled backward.
If you use UP with a PFK and an 'M' in the
command field the 'BOTTOM' command will be executed.
:edl.
:lblbox.Notes.
:ul.
:li.All these commands can be set under a PFK.
So, you can use the PFKs instead of entering the commands
on the screen.
:li.If you print the data set with the 'PRINT' command
RPF will make header lines if the data set does not
contain ASA or machine control characters.
If the to be browsed input data set is a card image data set
(LRECL=80 and no control characters), a scale line will be
printed after the header lines and after each record, the
start column of the first non-blank character of that line
will be printed.
If the control characters are present RPF does not
make headers.
:li.If a RECFM=U data set is browsed/viewed, the output will be
formatted on the screen. The output records fit within the screen
width and more records will be written if the RECFM=U data set has
larger records. The output contains a HEX offset, the data line,
a record with the high-order HEX nibble, a record with the low-order
nibbles and a HEX ruler.
:eul.
:elblbox.
:h2 id=edit. EDIT a data set or PDS member.
:p.
If you select option '2' on the RPF main menu, the EDIT function
will be performed.
.br
The EDIT data entry screen contains of two parts.
:ol.
:li.The data entry screen.
In this part of the screen you can perform the allocation
of the data set to be edited.
If the allocations are alright, the data set or PDS member will
be edited and the EDIT screen appears, otherwise the user will be
prompted for retry.
:li.The data set selection list.
:eol.
You can select the data sets in two ways:
:ul c.
:li.Select the member name/data set name (and volume serial) in
the allocation menu.
:li.Select 1 of the data sets in the data set selection menu, by
placing the cursor in the line of the requested data set and hitting
ENTER.
:eul.
:p.
If '=n(.n)' is entered in the member name or data set name,
RPF returns to the main menu and executes option n(.n).
.br
After selection of this data set, the Edit function will be invoked.
and the data set (and volume serial) will be placed in selection list.
This selection list will be written in the RPF data set, if
you leave RPF.
If you want to cancel the function, press PF03 or PF15.
:p.
If the member is not specified, a member selection list has
been displayed.
If you select an 'S' in front of the chosen member, The editor
will be invoked. See also :hdref refid=pdsm for information about
The 'S' line command.
:p.
If the member does not exist, an input screen will be made with 1
screen blank lines and in the header line will appear 'Input  mmmmmmm'.
'mmmmmmmmm' is the data set name and (member) if present.
If the data set or member exists: 'Input' is replaced by 'Edit'.
If the data set is edited you can change your data in fullscreen mode.
The screen is divided into 5 parts:
:ul c.
:li.The header, containing the data set name, the member name
and the ISPF version/modification level (vv.mm) if available.
:li.The message area for the informational and error messages
:li.The BNDS field with the editor boundaries.
:li.The scroll amount.
:li.The data area, containing the data to be edited.
:eul.
The editor can be entered in standard or in COBOL mode and
will be automatically detected.
In the standard mode, the amount of columns to display is the width
of the screen minus 8 or the complete record if the record fits
in the screen. Example: if the LRECL of the data set is 133 and
the width of the screen is 80, 72 columns will be displayed.
If the record of the data does not fit on the screen, the RIGHT
and LEFT can be used to scroll.
.br
In the COBOL mode columns 7-78 will be displayed if an 80-column
screen is used. The line numbers (if present)
or created by the 'RENUM' command will affect cols 1-6.
COBOL mode works only if the record length of the data
set = 80.
.sp
If the the last 8 columns or columns 1-6 (COBOL only) of the
data set are numbered,
manual modification of these columns is ignored.
.br
In both cases, you can work with line-numbers in the commands,
because the numbers on the screen are NOT in the data set
.br
If a data set does not contain line numbers,
the editor will be entered in 'NONUM' mode.
.br
If you do program development press CAPS LOCK, use the UC line
command, or enter the CAPS ON command.
.br
If the data contains unprintable characters,
the lines with unprintable characters cannot be edited.
.br
If you have entered a wrong command or invalid command the command
will be repeated, so you can make easy your corrections.
:p.There are two types of commands:
.br
The primary commands entered in the 'command' field
(see :hdref refid=eprim ).
.br
Line commands entered in the linenumber fields
(see :hdref refid=eline ).
:h3 id=eprim. EDIT primary commands.
:p.
The EDIT primary commands are described in alphabetic order below:
:dl tsize=18
:dthd.Primary command
:ddhd.Function
:dt.=n or =n.n
:dd.Terminate the editor, return to MAIN and option 'n' or
'n.n' will be executed. The data will be saved if changes are made.
:dt.APPEND
:dd.Append another data set or member in the EDIT workspace.
After entering 'APPEND', the data set menu will appear.
Alter the allocations and press ENTER to append.
With the END command the data will be saved in the data set/member
which is initially edited.
:dt.AUTOSAVE ON/OFF
:dd.Turn on or off AUTOSAVE. With AUTOSAVE ON, the data will be
automatically saved.
.br
With AUTOSAVE OFF and the data is changed, RPF EDIT will issue
the message 'Enter SAVE, CANCEL or END'.
.br
If SAVE entered, the data will be saved and the editor will terminate.
.br
If CANCEL entered, RPF stays in the editor.
.br
If END entered, EDIT will execute the primary command CANCEL.
.br
The initial value (ON or OFF) will be controlled by the
AUTOSAVE parameter in the defaults (option 0.1).
:dt.BNDS n,m
:dd.With this command you can set the range of columns
which will be used in 'C', 'F', 'FILL', 'UC',
'LC' and 'SORT' primary commands.
.br
If you enter this command without operands:
.br
1. If COBOL is set to ON, the boundaries are column 7
to 72.
.br
2. If the edited data set/member contains fixed records the
boundary range covers the visible part of the data in the screen.
If the data is numbered and the visible part is the end of
the record or the complete record, the end boundary is record
length - 8.
3. If the edited data set/member contains variable records, the
boundary range covers the visible part of the data in the screen.
If the data is numbererd the start boundary is set to 9, if the
visible part of the data is positioned from the beginning.
.br
If the second operand is 999, the end boundary is the
record length of the data set or member.
.br
Another possibility to set the boundary range is
changing the 'BNDS' value in the right corner
of the EDIT screen.
:dt.BOTTOM
:dd.Display last screen of the data set.
This command may be abbreviated as 'B'
:dt.C /aaa/bbb/(A)
:dd.With this command, you can change character strings
throughout your entire workspace.
If you do not specify the 'A' after the last
delimiter, only the first line on the screen will
be changed, otherwise the first line till the end
of the workspace will be changed.
If you enter 'C /string//(A)' the character string
will be deleted.
With 'C //string/(A)' the character string will be
inserted before the first character of the line,
or all lines if 'A' is specified.
The delimiter can be any character.
Only character strings will be changed, which are
in the column-range, that is set by the 'BNDS' primary command.
:dt.C /aa/bb/n,m
:dd.With this form of the 'C' command you can make
changes in a specified line range (n,m). both
numbers should be specified. If you want to
change 1 line use first the 'L nnnn' command
and after this command 'C /aaa/bbb/'.
If n = '*' change will be done beginning with the
current line.
In this case the second number should be after the current line.
:dt.C /x'hh..'/bbb/n,m  or C /x'hh..'/bbb/(A)
:dd.Change HEX character(s) 'hh..' into 'bbb'
The 'x' can be specified in lower- or upper-case.
:dt.C /aaa/x'hh..'/n,m  or C /aaa/x'hh..'/(A)
:dd.Change string 'aaa' into HEX string 'hh..'
The 'x' can be specified in lower- or upper-case.
:dt.C /x'hh..'/x'jj..'/n,m  or C /x'hh..'/x'jj..'/(A)
:dd.Change HEX string 'hh..'into HEX string 'jj..'
The 'x' can be specified in lower- or upper-case.
.br.
Example 1: C /X'404040'/X'2020'/A change 3 blanks into
2x X'20'. C /   /X'2020'/A is equivalent.
:dt.C /P'.'/bb/n,m or C /P'.'/x'hh..'/(n,m) or (A)
:dd.Change invalid characters into string 'bb' or
into HEX string x'hh..'.
.br.
Example 2: C /P'.'/ /A  Change all invalid characters
into a blank. C /P'.'/X'40'/a is equivalent.
.br
If a line is successfully changed, the line number will be reversed.
:dt.CANCEL
:dd.Terminate the RPF EDIT function, without saving
the workspace. This command may be abbreviated as 'CAN'.
.br

:h2.TSO command processor RPFED
:p.
In native TSO, the TSO command processor RPFED is available.
You can use the TSO command RPFED to edit a data set or
member, RPFBR to browse a data set or member, RPFPD
to invoke Library Functions or RPFST to perform RESET ISPF stats
function.
:p.
Syntax:
:xmp.
RPFED data setname VOLUME(vvvvvv) LINES(nnnnn)
RPFBR data setname VOLUME(vvvvvv) LINES(nnnnn)
RPFPD data setname VOLUME(vvvvvv) LINES(nnnnn)
RPFST data setname VOLUME(vvvvvv) LINES(nnnnn) +
      NEWUSER(new userid) VERSION(nnnn)
:exmp.
:p.
The VOLUME keyword is optional and can be used if the 'data setname'
is not cataloged.
:p.
The LINES keyword specified the maximum lines to process
and should be a value between 200 and 50,000. The default is
7,000 lines.
.br
If RPFED/RPFBR/RPFPD and RPFST runs in addressing mode 31, the number
of lines will be automatically multiplied by 10.
:p.
The NEWUSER and VERSION keywords are optional and only used if
the RPFST (Reset ISPF stats) command verb is used.
The default value for NEWUSER is your TSO userid. The default for
VERSION = 0100 (ISPF vv + ISPF mm).
:p.
RPFED will invoke the RPF editor or the Edit member selection list.
.br
RPFBR will invoke the RPF browser or the Browse member selection list.
.br
RPFPD will invoke RPF Library Functions. If using RPFPD,
'data setname' should be a partitioned data set.
.br
RPFST executes the RESET ISPF stats function.
'data set name' should be a partitioned data set.
:p.
The normal TSO rules are in effect. If omitting the data
set name, the command processor will prompt you for the
data set. If you put the data set name between apostrophes,
the data set is treated as fully qualified. If no
apostrophes are used, the data set name will be prefixed with
your user id.
:p.
See :hdref refid=edit for a description of the editor and the
Edit member selection list or :hdref refid=brw for a description
of the browse and the Browse member selection list or
:hdref refid=reset for a description of the RESET function,

:xmp.
RPFV { PREFIX(dsn-prefix) | PREFIX(NONE) VOLUME(volser)
       LINES(nnnnn) }
:exmp.
:p.
Default for PREFIX is the userid. Default for VOLUME = blanks.
The PREFIX is a fuzzy prefix. Prefixes like 'SYS1' or
or 'SYS1.L' are both valid
:p.
If the volume serial is specified, only the data sets with this
prefix are selected.
.br
If PREFIX(NONE) is specified, a volume serial is required to
create a data set list of all data sets of that volume.
:p.
The LINES keyword specified the maximum lines to process
and should be a value between 200 and 50,000. The default is
7,000 lines.
.br
If RPFV runs in addressing mode 31, the number
of lines will be automatically multiplied by 10.

:note.Notes
:ul c.
:li.The modules with AMODE N/A are loaded and called, so the
addressing mode will be inherited from the caller.
:li.All the RPF programs are written in Assembler-XF.
:li.RPF uses 11 user macros and 3 copy members:
:ol c.
:li.CALLTS:   general IKJDAIR execution routine (copy code).
:li.CSR:      convert SBA to row/column,
:li.DSNPARS:  copy member to parse the data set names (copy code).
:li.JCLCOMM:  used in the JCL processor,
:li.RCTOSBA:  calculatie a row/column to SBA,
:li.RPFCOMM:  macro to define the RPF common area,
:li.RPFPROF:  mapping macro of the @RPFPROF member,
:li.RPFSA24:  conditional switch to AMODE 24 and
:li.RPFSA31:  conditional switch to AMODE 31.
:li.RPFSORT:  sort the EDIT workspace on a certain field.
:li.SUBR:     call subroutines in RPFJCL1.
:li.SYCONVHX: the convert hex to EBCDIC macro,
:li.SYSVARS:  contains environment variables. Examine this
member and change the values according your environment.
This is only needed if you assemble the sources.
:li.TPUTS:    copy code for terminal I/O.
:eol.
:li.Special for MVS38J and MVS/380 user's, 2 dummy macros called
AMODE and RMODE are made to get correct assemblies with the
Assembler-XF. If Assembler-H (IEV90) or HL-ASM (ASMA90) are used,
do not use these macros.
:li.For MVS38J and MVS/380 user's, 2 modified macros (GETMAIN and
IHBOPLST) are made. You can copy these macros to SYS1.MACLIB, use
job COPYMAC in the RPF JCL library. See chapter below.
.br
A better way is to include RPF.V200.MACLIB (rpf200s1.zip) as first
library in the SYSLIB concatenation of the assembly of RPF
(MVS38J only).
.br
The modifications on GETMAIN and IHBOPLST are made by Paul Edwards.
:eul.
:h3.Installation and requirements.
:p.
RPF will be distributed as 7 zipped XMI data sets. You will find
these files on www.prince-webdesign.nl/rpf.
:ul c.
:li.File 1. rpf200mv.zip, the MVS38J and MVS380 load modules.
:li.File 2. rpf200os.zip, the OS/390 and z/OS load modules.

:li.File 4. rpf200jc.zip, the RPF JCL library.
:li.File 5. rpf200as.zip, the RPF source library.
:li.File 6. rpf200pn.zip, the RPF ISPF panels.
:li.File 7. rpf200s1.zip, the RPF macro library (for MVS38J and
MVS380 only).
:li.File 8. rpf200svas.zip, the RPF source library for OS/VS2 rel. 1
(SVS).
:li.File 9. rpf200vsld.zip, the SVS load modules
:eul.
:p.
Files 1-4 are required to install RPF. Files 5 and 6 are optional.
:p.
After unzip, the files should be uploaded to your system with
IND$FILE. After upload use the utility $RECV370 or the TSO command
RECEIVE INDATASET.
.br
For Hercules or Hyperion user's, the dasdload function is
available.
:p.
A sample of a RECV370 job is below:

:exmp.
:figcap.Sample RECV370 job.
:efig.
:p.
An alternative way to install RPF is obtaining RPF from
www.cbttape.org. RPF is available in file 415 and will be
distributed as 1 zipped XMIT file, which can be obtained with
a Hyperion/Hercules dasdload function, with the RECV370 utility
of Jim Morrison (file 571 on www.cbttape.org) or with the TSO/E
RECEIVE INDATASET command.
After obtaining file 415, read the member @INSTALL carefully.
:p.
The job below is optional.
:ul c.
:li.Member AMODE31 in the JCL library to set the correct
correct addressing mode. This job is optional. Run this job
against SYS2.CMDLIB.
:eul.
:h3.TSOKEYxx in SYS1.PARMLIB
:p.
RPF needs the following minimum buffers in member TSOKEYxx in
SYS1.PARMLIB:
.br
HIBFREXT=16384
.br
LOBFREXT=8192
:h3.SMS support and Indexed VTOC's
:p.
RPF has the possibility to support indexed VTOC's and some SMS
facilities like PDS/E support and large volumes in OS/390
and z/OS systems.
.br
Use the file rpf200os.zip to install the OS390 or z/OS load modules.
With this support the package RPF/E has become obsolete.
:p.
If using indexed VTOC's in older systems like MVS/XA with DFP
installed, no large volumes are supported.
.br
Update member SYSVARS in the source library and set the variables
&SMS and &LARGE both to 0. Assemble and link RPFVTOC afterwards.
RPFVTOC should be linked with the RENT attribute.
:p.
After RPF has been installed into SYS2.CMDLIB or equivalent with
job $CMDLIB in the JCL library, you can delete the optional
data sets if you wish:
:ol c.
:li.RPF.V200.ASM
:li.RPF.V200.LOAD or RPF.V200.ZOS.LOAD
:li.RPF.V200.JCL
:li.RPF.V200.MACLIB
:eol.
:p.
Start RPF on your TSO terminal and enter option 3.4 (data set list)
and specify 'RPF' (without quotes) in the PREFIX field.
Place a D before the data set name (and confirm the deletion with
PF12 of PF24).
:h3.Other requirements.
:p.
All the RPF modules can be assembled and linked separately.
:p.
The default unitname of existing not-cataloged data sets is SYSALLDA.
The default unitname of newly created and temporary workdata sets is
SYSDA. These defaults can be changed by applying the following ZAP
:fig place=inline frame=box concat=no.

The module RPFLIB needs the file access interface
routines of the LIBRARIAN package.
Upon link edit of RPFLIB the following modules should be
included from the LIBRARIAN loadlibrary:
1. FAIROPN.  2. FAIRMOD.  3. FAIRREC.  4. FAIRCLS.
:p.
:lblbox.Note
The RPF common area can be mapped, by using the 'RPFCOMM'
macro.
:elblbox.
:p.
If you want to use the HAR primary command of RPF, then include
the application 'RPFHCPY' in application major node of your
VTAM definition library.
Example how to define RPFHCPY follows below:
:fig place=inline frame=box concat=no.
:xmp.
RPFHCPY APPL AUTH=(ACQ) /* HAR COMMAND OF RPF */
:exmp.
:figcap.define RPFHCPY
:efig.
In the main menu (option 5) is a user exit available:
The name of the exit should be RPFUSER1.
Each function in RPFUSER1 is allowed; e.g. filling the workspace,
link and call other RPF-routines.
The entry points of the following RPF routines are available
The entry points can be found in the 'RPFCOMM' area.
:ol c.
:li.RPFEDIT (field named EPEDIT)
:li.RPFDATAL (field named EPDATAL)
:li.RPFDAIR (field named EPDAIR)

:li.RPFVTOC1 (field named EPVTOC1)
:li.RPFC3270 (field named EPC3270)
:li.RPFCNVDT (field named EPCNVDT)
:eol.
The other RPF routines can be obtained by the 'LINK' macro
In register 1 in RPFUSER1 is placed an address of a fullword,
which contains the address of the 'RPFCOMM' area, which can be
mapped by using the 'RPFCOMM' macro.
It is recommended to use reg 11 as the address of the 'RPFCOMM'
area and to use reg 13 as the base register.
If you want to give a message in the RPF main menu upon exit of the
RPFUSER1 routine, you can place a 25 byte message in field 'COMMPRM'
of the 'RPFCOMM' area.
If you have no RPFUSER1 exit in your installation, RPF will ignore
the exit accompanied with the message:
'RPFUSER1 not found'
